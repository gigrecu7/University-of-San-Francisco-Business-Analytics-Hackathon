Hello!This is the code to the 2021 University of San Francisco Business Analytics Hackathon.
3 datasets wer provided. The first dataset included price data of Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. 
The second dataset contained 8000 tweets with #dogecoin & #altcoin and the last dataset was a 
merged file of the prior two. The data was cleaned using R to capture frequency of words, 
word trends and extracting the top 30 words in the tweets. The work in R was visualized in Tableau.
