# University-of-San-Francisco-Business-Analytics-Hackathon
Hello! I completed this hackathon with two other students and we competed against 5 other 
teams in which we presented our findings to a panel of judges. We were provided with 3 datasets. 
The first dataset included price data of Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. 
The second dataset contained 8000 tweets with #dogecoin & #altcoin and the last dataset was a 
merged file of the prior two.We were asked to explore areas such as impact of twitter and the different
kinds of tweets on the price, market cap and volume of the cryptocurrencies as well as the influence Elon Musk 
had on the cyrptocurrencies through twitter. We cleaned the data using R to capture frequency of words, 
word trends and extracting the top 30 words in the tweets. We then visualized our work and findings from R in 
Tableau and our overall presentation of our findings led us to successfully placing in first, you can check it out below!Â
